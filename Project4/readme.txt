Environment: Windows, C++
My classes: virtualBitmap(num of total bits, num of bits in virtual counter)

All variables in parentheses, and input file name can be set in "main.cpp". (line 60 and line 91)
Implementations are all in "main.cpp", which is for the convenience of reading and compiling.
virtualBitmap: uses a bool array to store bits, and an int array to store random values which is used for hashes.

With the given input and not setting random seed:
actual-estimated figure is in virtualbitmap.pdf.
*** draw.py is used to draw figure.
*** data.txt is output file of main code, contains lines of actual and estimated value.
